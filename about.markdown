Hi there! I'm a Brazilian DevOps Engineer currently living in the Netherlands. With a strong passion for Cloud Native applications, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code, I thrive in creating scalable and efficient solutions.

When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll find me enjoying football, binge-watching TV series and movies, or building intricate Lego creations. I also love traveling and exploring new places with my wife.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
